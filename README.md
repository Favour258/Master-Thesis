## Project Title
**The Source, Composition, and Pollution Levels of Heavy Metals in Rainfed Tropical Urban Agricultural Soils**

## Introduction
This repository contains the full set of scripts and data used for my master's thesis, which focuses on analyzing and visualizing the impact of urbanization on soil health. The project involves a comprehensive data science workflow, including data cleaning, preprocessing, transformation, statistical analysis, and visualization.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into folders based on specific research questions. Each folder contains:
- **`scr/`**: All R scripts used for data processing, analysis, and visualization.
- **`output/`**: The results and plots generated from the scripts.
- **`data/`**: Processed datasets used in the analysis.

Additionally, there is a **`Data/`** folder that contains the original datasets used in the analysis.

## Research Questions
1. **Comparison of Heavy Metal Measurement Methods**: How do heavy metal concentrations measured using the fast portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF) method compare to the standard laboratory (ICP-OES) techniques?
2. **Geochemical Background Estimation**: Which statistical method for calculating local geochemical background (LGB) values of heavy metals provides the best estimation? In this study, the calculated distribution function (CDF) was chosen, with a justification provided.
3. **Urbanization Impact**: How does an increase in urbanization intensity impact the accumulation of heavy metals in tropical urban agricultural soils?
4. **Pollution Levels and Human Health Risk**: What are the pollution levels and associated human health risks in the study area?

## Results and Visualizations
The output files include:
- Visualizations such as boxplots, scatter plots, and correlation heat maps.
- Statistical summaries of the dataset.

## Repository Content
- **`Methods/`**: Contains scripts and outputs for the first research question.
- **`Geochemical Background/`**: Contains scripts and outputs for the second research question.
- **`Urbanization Impact/`**: Contains scripts and outputs for the third research question.
- **`Pollution Level and Human Health Assessment/`**: Contains scripts and outputs for the fourth research question.
